## Privacy Policy

This Privacy Policy applies to the Visor application (the "App") for macOS.

### 1. Data Collection and Usage

The App does not directly collect, store, or process any personal data from users. However, there is one specific scenario in which the App connects to the internet:

- **Downloading macOS Installation Image:** The App allows users to download the official macOS installation image directly from Apple servers for setting up a virtual machine. During this process, the App does not collect or transmit any data from your device. However, Apple may collect certain information, such as your IP address, in accordance with their own privacy practices. For more details on how Apple handles such connections, please refer to Apple’s [Privacy Policy](https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/).

### 2. No Third-Party Integrations

Apart from connecting to Apple’s servers for downloading the macOS installation image, the App does not interact with any third-party services, analytics tools, or tracking mechanisms.

### 3. Updates to This Privacy Policy

This Privacy Policy may be updated periodically to reflect changes in the App or applicable legal requirements.

### 4. Contact and Support

For any questions, feedback, or issues, please submit them through the [GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/xorgal/VisorApp/issues).
